## Technical Specifications
| Technology  | Version |
| ----------- | --------|
| Node.js     | 14.18.3 |
| Vue.js      | 3       |
| TypeScript  | 4.7.4   |
| Vite        | 3       |
| Sass        | 1.55    |

## Installation
1. Clone repo
2. Make sure to be on correct Node.js version. Project uses **14.18.3**. If you have `nvm` installed, you can run `nvm use` in the terminal to automatically select the project version.
3. Once in correct Node.js version, install packages using `npm install`.
4. Once packages are installed, run `npm run dev` to start development server.

Alternatively, I have also included an already built (static) version of the app located in `~/dist`. You can use any web server of your choice to browse the app this way.

**Thanks!**
